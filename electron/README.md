---
GUI for visualizing VDM model variables.


How to build
---
The app is built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). You need npm (comes with Node.js). We use Gulp
to manage tasks. It's easiest to have it installed globally (`npm install -g
gulp`). 

After checking out the repo...

1. To install node dependencies: `npm install`
2. To install other resources: `gulp init`
3. To build the UI: `gulp`
4. To run it: `npm start`


Editor
---
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice. It's
cross-platform and is actually built on top of Electron. JetBrains WebStorm is also a good tool. That said, you can use
whatever you want.
